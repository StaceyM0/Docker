docker-compose images (lets you view images built form the docker-compose file)
docker-compose ps (similar to docker ps, this lists all containers in the docker-compose file)
docker -compose top (list the processes inside each service)
docker-compose pause (pauses a service that is running)
docker-compose unpause (unpauses the service)
docker-compose stop (use this command only if you want to stop all containers and services)
